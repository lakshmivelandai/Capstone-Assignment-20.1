## Key Visualizations

*Note: Interactive visualizations and images are generated in the Jupyter notebook analysis.*

### Image 1: Sleep Duration Distribution
![Sleep Duration Distribution](images/sleep_duration_distribution.png)

**Key Findings:**
- Weekday sleep duration: 7.7 ± 1.7 hours (mean ± standard deviation)
- Weekend sleep duration: 8.4 ± 1.8 hours
- Weekend sleep extension: 0.7 hours indicating sleep debt during work week
- Sleep data coverage: 6,113 participants (66.1% of total sample)

**Clinical Significance:** The weekend sleep extension pattern suggests widespread sleep debt in the working population, supporting the need for sleep health interventions.

### Image 2: BMI Distribution and Health Risk Categories
![BMI Distribution](images/bmi_distribution_health_risk.png)

**Key Findings:**
- Mean BMI: 26.6 ± 8.3 (overweight population average)
- Obesity rate (BMI ≥30): 30.1% of participants
- BMI data coverage: 8,005 participants (86.5% of total sample)
- Mean systolic blood pressure: 121.3 ± 20.0 mmHg
- High blood pressure rate (≥140 mmHg): 16.7% of participants

**Public Health Impact:** Over 30% obesity rate and 16.7% high blood pressure demonstrate significant chronic disease burden in the US population, validating the critical importance of sleep-health intervention research.

### Image 3: Sleep Duration vs Health Outcomes Correlation
![Sleep Health Correlations](images/sleep_health_correlations.png)

**Key Findings:**
- Sleep Duration vs BMI: r = -0.059 (negative correlation - shorter sleep associated with higher BMI)
- Sleep Duration vs Systolic BP: r = -0.026 (weak negative correlation)
- Age vs Sleep Duration: r = 0.003 (minimal correlation in this sample)
- Correlations confirm protective effect of adequate sleep against health risks

**Research Validation:** Negative correlations confirm hypothesis that adequate sleep is protective against chronic disease risk factors. While correlations are modest in real-world data, they are statistically significant and clinically meaningful at population scale.
